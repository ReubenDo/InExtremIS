                This corresponds to the weights `\alpha` in [1].
            reduction: {``"none"``, ``"mean"``, ``"sum"``}

                - ``"none"``: no reduction will be applied.
                - ``"mean"``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of elements in the output.
                - ``"sum"``: the output will be summed.
